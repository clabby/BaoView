# Bao View

Bao View is a web-facing application written in React that gives users a more in-depth view of their staked pools on [Bao Finance](https://bao.finance).

## To do
This project is still in early stages, and there is a good bit left to do. I plan on expanding support to xDai Sushi LPs, mainnet, and eventually other Bao franchises as well. To see what is currently being worked on, see TODO.md. Feel free to fork and submit a pull request to this document if you have any features in mind!

## Issues
If possible, please report any issues found to the issues tab in the Git repository, not my Discord. It is much easier to keep track of each one here :smile:
