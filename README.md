# Bao View

![BaoViewPreview](https://i.imgur.com/qUVOnVd.png)

Bao View is a web-facing React application that gives users both general analytics and a more in-depth view of their staked value in liquidity pools on [Bao Finance](https://bao.finance).

## To do
This project is still in early stages, and there is a good bit left to do. I plan on expanding support to xDai Sushi LPs (:white_check_mark:), mainnet, and eventually other Bao franchises as well. To see what is currently being worked on, see TODO.md. Feel free to fork and submit a pull request to this document if you have any features in mind!

## Issues
If possible, please report any issues found to the issues tab in the Git repository, not my Discord. It is much easier to keep track of each one here :smile:
