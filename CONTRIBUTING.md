### Cloning and Installing Dependencies
To contribute to BaoView, you're going to need to start off by getting a local
version of the website running on your machine.

`git clone git@github.com:clabby/BaoView.git`

Then:

`npm install`

`npm run start`

OR, if you prefer to use yarn:

`yarn`

`yarn start`

Finally, add your Infura API key to the `env.json` file in the root directory. (`env.sample.json` is available for reference)

### Pull Requests

After you've modified your version and created a feature, submit a pull request for review if you think it should be added to the website!

All contributors to the main fork will have their respective donation wallet links added to the about page. :smile:
